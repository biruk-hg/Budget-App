# Budget-App
The Category class for managing financial transactions and a function create_spend_chart for visualizing spending across multiple categories. 
The Category class includes an initializer that sets up a category with a name and an empty ledger list to record transactions. The class features several methods: deposit to add money to the ledger, ensuring the amount is positive; withdraw to remove money from the ledger if there are sufficient funds, recording the amount as negative; get_balance to calculate the current balance by summing the amounts in the ledger; transfer to move funds between categories by performing a withdrawal in the current category and a deposit in the target category; and check_funds to verify if there are enough funds available for a withdrawal. Additionally, the class includes a __str__ method to provide a formatted string representation of the ledger. The create_spend_chart function generates a bar chart displaying the percentage of total spending per category. It calculates total withdrawals for each category, computes the corresponding spending percentages, and builds a visual representation with percentage markers and category names displayed vertically.
